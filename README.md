# icalc

This is a command-line based calculator which mimics how the Python interactive 
interpreter evaluates mathematical expressions.

You can run icalc in interactive, read-eval-print loop (REPL) mode or just call 
it from the command-line supplying the expression it is to evaluate and print/
return a result.
